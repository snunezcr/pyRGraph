# pyRGraph
A Python graphical interface for making graphics in R, targeted at both simple or detailed ggplot2 usage.

ggplot2 is a powerful graphics utility that requires a significant amount of proficiency in the use of R for obtaining publication quality results. This project attempts to bring all the powerful features of ggplot2 through a GUI that provides configuration ranging from default settings to fully customized output.

This work is partially funded by the Civic Network of Weather Stations in Costa Rica (RECIEM).
