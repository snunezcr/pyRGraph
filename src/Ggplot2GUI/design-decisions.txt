Design Decisions
----------------

Given that the approach here will be a managed one, some of the functions
specified in the standard for ggplot2 version 2.1.0 will not be implemented.
This choice depends on generating new images at each point. It is simpler, tough
less efficient.

The following lists indicate what was NOT implemented.

Based on each section of: http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/

Themes:
* add_theme
* calc_element
